"""
Extracting value from the time series gets complicated really quickly. Yes, one can plug them into a monitoring
stack and get some visualisations. Going further, into analytics, ML and forecasting, things become far less 
easy. We suddenly need data scientist, ML engineers and a whole lot of computational resources.

The [Time2Vec: Learning a Vector Representation of Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05321.pdf) research paper 
proposes a time series vector embedding model with many applications. This demo is based on [this](https://github.com/ojus1/Date2Vec) implementation
of it.
